# schema.vc

schema.vc is a Python library for building electronic circuits.

* **Declarative**: schema.vc makes it painless to create electronic schematics. Design simple blocks for each subsystem in your device, and compose system using this functional components. The declarative definition makes your schematic simpler to understand and easier to modify.
* **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their properties, then compose them to make complex devices. Since component logic is written in Python instead of graphic schematics, you can easily pass rich data through your components and control valuable parameters.
